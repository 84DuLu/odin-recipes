    <p>
    My mother was one of the best cooks I ever knew. Whenever 
    she made stews we mostly found homemade dumplings in them.
    We never ate things from packages or microwaves and you sure  
    could taste what food was. That's the only way I cook today - I 
    don't use any electronic gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.

                Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, 
                and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture 
                is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter 
                forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a 
                spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.

                Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. 
                Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. 
                Serve.
